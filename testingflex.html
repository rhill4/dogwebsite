<h1> About Us</h1>

<p class= "AUp">
Paws Paradise is an organization completely dedicated to your pet’s happiness. You ask us to sit, stay or rollover for your pet and we’re likely to do it! We’ll do anything to see that tail wag! We pride ourselves in providing outstand individualized care to all of our Paws Paradise guests.
Our goal at Paws Paradise to be a home away from home, or in the case of dog walking – the cool aunt that always takes you to do cool stuff! We know that leaving your pup at home while you’re at work, or at a boarders while you’re away can be stressful and we’re striving to change that. We want your pup to be excited every time they see us and for you to be relaxed when they’re in our care. All members of our staff are dedicated animal lovers with years of experience and comprehensive background checks so you can be sure your pet is in good hands.
